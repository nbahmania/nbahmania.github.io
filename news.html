            <p>Corporate performance of Indian companies in the fourth quarter of financial year 2025 remained satisfactory despite a tough global economic environment, according to a recent report by Bank of Baroda. The report highlighted that most companies are optimistic about their future growth prospects, and there is potential for further improvement once consumption demand picks up in FY26.</p>

            <p>The Indian banking regulator is signalling possible rule changes ahead that would let foreigners own more of India's banks, spurred by overseas institutions' eagerness for acquisitions and the fast-growing economy's need for more long-term capital. The Reserve Bank of India last month bent its rules to let Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp buy a 20% stake in Yes Bank, and two foreign institutions are vying for a stake in IDBI Bank, highlighting the pressure to ease foreign ownership rules that are among the strictest of any major economy.</p>
