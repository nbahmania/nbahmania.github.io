            <p>IT services major HCLTech will release its Q1FY26 earnings report today (July 14) with analysts expecting muted growth in a seasonally weak quarter. This seasonal softness, according to analysts, may have been exacerbated by weak demand amid persistent tariff-related uncertainty.</p>

Looking at the earnings growth, quality of growth, a chronic-focussed India business, strong balance sheet and a healthy speciality pipeline, the brokerage sees Sun Pharma as the leader among the P4 and has assigned it the only 'Overweight' rating.</p>
