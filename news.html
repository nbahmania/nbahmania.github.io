            <p>Indian fugitive Mehul Choksi was arrested by law enforcement in Belgium on Saturday due to his alleged involvement in fraudulent activities. However, extraditing the fugitive diamond merchant may prove to be a tough task. The 65-year-old Choksi has been wanted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) in India since 2018, after it was discovered that he had allegedly defrauded the Punjab National Bank (PNB) of ₹ 13,850 crore.</p>
